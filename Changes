Revision history for Perl extension Locale::PO.

0.27  Dec 15 2014
   -  Fix RT#94231 (previous — fuzzy — msgid, #|). Thanks to Raphael Hertzog
      for reporting it. Added a test case now, but previous messages are
      treated like fuzzy messages, so use fuzzy_msgid().

0.26  Dec 14 2014
   -  Fix RT#42811 (don't add a flag twice). Thanks to Jason Sill for his
      bug report from 2009 (!). Jason, sorry and better late than never.

0.25  Dec 14 2014
   -  This release now should work reliably on Linux, MSWin32, msys and
      I believe also MacOS, also when writing PO files from one platform
      and reading them back on another. Hopefully :-)
   -  Fix RT#99069 (\ not being escaped). Thanks to Jeff Fearn.
   -  Fix RT#87374 (mixed \r\n handling problems). Thanks to Jason
      Fesler for the bug report.
